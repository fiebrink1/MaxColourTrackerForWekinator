# MaxColourTrackerForWekinator
Uses webcam to track a colour and sends data via OSC. Implemented in Max/MSP with Jitter.

Based heavily on Jitter colour tracking tutorial at [https://docs.cycling74.com/max5/tutorials/jit-tut/jitterchapter25.html](https://docs.cycling74.com/max5/tutorials/jit-tut/jitterchapter25.html)

Most other implementation based on work by Sam Parke-Wolf done in our [Sound Control](https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/SoundControl) project. OSC capability and code paring down added by Rebecca Fiebrink.

Can be used without modification to send OSC data to [Wekinator](www.wekinator.org).
